This code is for creating a polar histogram of the outputs from our Golgi_orientation_analysis FIJI macro. The polar histogram function is used in Matlab. 
*Note: The values from the Golgi_orientation_analysis must be converted to radians before entered into the Matlab code with each value separated by a new line.
The following variables can be easily edited at the top of the macro:
	theta: The angle values should be inserted here as radian values.
	nbins: The number of bins can be changed here.
The Normalization or Color features of the graph can be modified at the end after 'Normalization' and 'Face color'.
The graph should then be saved as a .fig or .svg file.
