This code measures microtubule bundling via intensity profile at the leading edge during migration. 
The user is prompted to select a folder as the output destination.
Then the user ensures that the wound is at the top of the image so that the cells are migrating upwards.
In the microtubule channel, a uniform box (600 X 340 microns) is placed so that it is comprised of 3/4 cells and 1/4 of the wound. Next, a vertical plot profile is created from the box (as an average of the vertical lines across the box).
The box position is saved as an ROI and the vertical plot data is saved as a csv file.
