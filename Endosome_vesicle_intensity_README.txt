This code measures the mean fluorescence intensity of the early endosomes. 
The user is prompted to select a folder as the output destination.
Then the user draws a freehand line designating the perimeter of a single cell in the actin channel. 
The endosome channel is selected and the min, max, and mean fluorescence intensity are measured. 
The cell perimeter is saved as an ROI and fluorescence intensity measurements are saved as a csv file.
